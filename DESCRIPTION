Title: Regularized Bayesian Regression for Small-Sample Two-Level Latent Variable Models
Version: 0.0.1.0
Description: MultiLevelOptimalBayes is an R package designed for researchers, 
    in psychology, education, and related fields who face challenges in 
    estimating between-group effects in two-level latent variable models,particularly 
    with small sample sizes. The package implements a regularized Bayesian 
    approach that optimizes the estimation of between-group coefficients by minimizing 
    Mean Squared Error (MSE),balancing both variance and bias. This method provides more reliable estimates 
    in scenarios with limited data, offering a robust solution for 
    accurate parameter estimation in multilevel models.
